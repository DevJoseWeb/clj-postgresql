# postgresql

A Clojure library designed to help using more advanced PostgreSQL
features is Clojure projects.

## Usage

Depend on:
    [clj-postgresql "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
(Latest version: https://clojars.org/clj-postgresql)

	(ns ...
		(:require ...
			[clj-postgresql.core :as pg]))
	
	(defonce db (pg/pg-spec :host "localhost" :dbname "testdb" :username "myuser" :password "apassword"))
	(jdbc/query db ["SELECT ? AS testcolumn", (pg/pg-json {:foo "bar"})])

	(defonce pool (pg/pg-pool :host "localhost" :dbname "testdb" :username "myuser" :password "apassword"))
	(jdbc/query pool ["SELECT 1"])


### Connecting to database

The pg-spec and pg-pool functions use PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER and PGDATABASE environment variables
and the ~/.pgpass file by default. The function arguments can be used to override the connection
parameters in the environment. E.g.:

	(def db (pg-pool :dbname "anotherdb"))
	(jdbc/query db ["SELECT 'test'"])

The pool can be closed with:

	(close-pooled-db! db)
